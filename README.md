## Topic 1: Stablecoins in South Africa

---

## 📋 Topic Overview

Stablecoins are crypto assets designed to maintain a stable value relative to a reference asset. They are increasingly viewed as a core financial technology innovation with the potential to reshape digital payment systems and expand financial access. 

In developing economies such as South Africa, stablecoins are often promoted as tools for financial inclusion, offering low-cost, mobile-native transaction rails that can reach unbanked or underbanked users. However, these benefits may depend on stablecoin design choices that influence:
- Risk exposure
- Redemption stability  
- Operational resilience
- Regulatory compliance

⚠️ **Key Concern**: Poorly designed stablecoins may replicate or amplify existing vulnerabilities in the financial system, particularly for low-income users with limited recourse.

## 🔍 Research Context

### South Africa's Payment System Modernization
- **SARB Vision 2025**: Ongoing payment system modernization initiative
- **PayShap**: Real-time, low-cost payment platform implementation
- Focus on enhancing financial inclusion and digital payment adoption

### International Comparison: Brazil's Pix
- Instant payments system launched by Brazil's central bank
- Achieved significant digital payment penetration and financial inclusion **without** blockchain-based innovations
- Processes billions of transactions monthly
- Features: settlement in seconds, 24/7 availability, universal reach across financial institutions, fintechs, and mobile platforms

## ❓ Core Research Question

> **In countries that have developed or are actively implementing high-functioning, low-cost interoperable digital payment systems under public or regulated private oversight, do stablecoins offer any residual value? Or do they simply replicate existing services with added complexity and risk?**

## 🎯 Research Objectives

Investigate the comparative advantages and limitations of stablecoins in South Africa, focusing on:

### Technical Dimensions
1. **Transaction Cost** - Cost efficiency comparison
2. **Finality** - Settlement certainty and speed
3. **Security** - Risk management and protection mechanisms
4. **Financial Accessibility** - Reach to unbanked/underbanked populations
5. **Cross-border Interoperability** - International transaction capabilities
6. **Programmability** - Smart contract and automation features

### Institutional Dimensions
- Regulatory frameworks governing stablecoin issuance and usage
- Innovation enablers vs. constraints compared to conventional digital payment systems
- Policy implications for financial inclusion
